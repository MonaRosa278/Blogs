## [About]()

As a passionate learner and practitioner of machine learning, I created this blog to explore and share my understanding of fundamental concepts, algorithms, and their practical applications. The articles and implementations cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Building a multi-lingual translation model with Transformer architecture
- Constructing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) from scratch
- Exploring cross-entropy loss and its significance in machine learning
- Implementing BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) tokenization for text preprocessing
- And much more!

Through this blog, I hope to not only reinforce my own understanding but also contribute to the broader machine learning community by sharing knowledge and fostering discussions.

## Articles

The `_posts` directory contains a collection of articles that delve into various machine learning concepts, techniques, and algorithms. Each article provides explanations, insights, and examples to help readers grasp the underlying principles and their applications. Feel free to explore the articles and learn alongside me!

## Implementations

In addition to theoretical explanations, this blog features practical implementations of machine learning models and algorithms. The `implementations` directory houses the code for projects such as building a multi-lingual translation model using the Transformer architecture and constructing BERT from scratch. These implementations serve as a hands-on way to understand and apply the concepts discussed in the articles.

## Getting Started

To get started with this blog, simply clone the repository and navigate through the directories to access the articles and implementations. The articles are written in Markdown format and can be easily read using any Markdown viewer or text editor. The implementations are organized in separate directories, each containing the necessary code and documentation.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-blog.git
cd machine-learning-blog
```
